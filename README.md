# Copper data Analytics

#Overview
This repository contains a business analytics project that demonstrates the application of various data analysis techniques to drive data-driven decision-making. The project involves extracting insights from complex datasets, building machine learning models, and creating interactive visualizations to support informed decision-making.

#Project Description
The project consists of several components:

Data Analysis: Extracted insights from datasets using Power BI and Excel.
Machine Learning: Built a machine learning model using Decision Tree Regressor to predict selling price and decision tree classifier to predict win or lost status on a Copper dataset using Python

Interactive Webpage: Developed an interactive webpage using Streamlit library in Python, integrating SQL functionality for dynamic querying and some questions answered on webpage.
Webpage Design: Designed the webpage with HTML, including a custom login page, and options to navigate to a dashboard or the Streamlit-based tool.

Directory Structure
Python Model Building: Contains the Python code for building the machine learning model, including data preprocessing, handling outliers and null values, and model training as well as codes for using mysql on webpage (For sql you need to create a server using SQl server).

Final File of Project: Contains the Streamlit code for building the interactive webpage,dynamic querying Using MySQL.

Login and Welcome: Contains the HTML code for designing the custom login page and welcome page.

Power BI Dashboard
Power BI Dashboard - Interactive dashboard for data visualization and exploration.
